I will say in all the instances of asset set, let's now look at key features of a set.

The key feature of a set.

The first is what A set is unordered.

It doesn't matter how you arrange it.

That is to say, if you have this as a set.

Say two, four, six.

Okay.

It is the same thing as.

462.

Anyhow you arrange the element does not matter.

So we say what the element and what unordered the element in a set.

Have no specific word order.

This means that the set this and these are considered equal irrespective of how you would arrange them.

It doesn't matter.

Okay.

Another feature is unique element.

Unique element.

Because if.

For instance, you have this.

These elements are not unique.

There must be.

What unique element?

Okay.

So I've seen this place.

Each element in a set is what distinct meaning that an element can appear only once in a given set.

For example, this particular set, you can see this repetition here will be represented by what this

because this one is representing all the ones.

If there's another two that will represent all the twos and so on and so forth.

It means therefore there should not be any repetition when it comes to set.

Since elements in a set are unique, there is no repetition of element allowed in.

Is set.

These are the key features of a set.
