What is a set?

In mathematics, a set is a collection.

Remember the word collection?

If there is no collection.

You don't have set a collection.

Set of people.

Set of animals.

Set of plants.

A collection of what?

Distinct well defined object.

Remember.

Distinct.

Well defined.

No ambiguity where defined what objects because of the importance of this.

Word and this word.

We need to go further to look at the meaning of saying when.

Defined or distinct what is distinct or well defined object.

A distinct object refers to an item.

Or entity.

That is clearly distinguishable.

And separate from other items or entities.

Remember clearly what this.

Able.

No room for doubts.

You see, it is very clear, without any doubt.

This.

This object should have what?

Specific where defined properties or characteristics that allow them to be recognized and differentiated

them from other objects.

Now let's look at the example of what well defined object.

Well defined objects can include a wide variety of what items?

Such as numbers, letters.

Geometric.

Ship's color was evil.

Other sets.

Okay, Now let's look at an instance of what a well defined object.

Look at this.

What are you seeing?

We are seeing triangle if I show you a triangle.

You know what?

Have any doubt that this is a triangle?

Okay, If I show you a square.

No doubt.

If I show you a circle.

No doubt.

If I show you a Pentagon, you don't have any doubt.

You can't see a Pentagon.

I call it a circle.

Neither can you see a circle.

I call it a triangle because they are well defined shapes.

So the collection of this word defined shapes is what said.

What about non well defined objects?

You need to know that too.

Look at this.

I want to ask you among these which of them is not well defined?

So in this place, this is where define where you are happy.

You are happy.

You are happy.

Something's going on in your life.

You are happy.

Somebody can see you.

I said, This guy is happy and if you are sad this empty, we can see you.

I said, Oh, this guy is sad.

What's going on with him?

What is going on?

Please, what is going on with you?

You are sad because that sadness is what defined around him.

You can't see it without being confused.

Okay, what about this?

What is x here?

What is x?

What is x here?

What does X has to do with this group?

Not well defined.

So this is what the non defined object in this set.

So you cannot use it like this.

Okay.

In this context, you can't use X in this place.

When working with set, it is crucial to ensure that all elements are well defined, to maintain clarity

and facilitate accurate mathematical operation and reasoning.
