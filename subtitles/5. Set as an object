In this class.

Let's look at a set itself as an object.

You agree with me?

When you look at the element of a set, just an element.

That element is an object, a unique object.

The set itself can be considered as an object, just the way you consider the element of a set as an

object.

We also consider the entire set as an what object?

It means.

Said can be found as an element of another set.

You have a set.

You can find the set as an element of a larger set.

Let's see.

When we consider a set as an object, we treat the set itself as a single entity.

Okay because of this is said to be an element of another set.

Okay.

Could be an element of another set in such a case.

The set be considered as an object is a member of what a larger set.

Let's look at this example.

For example, if a is equal to this and B is equal to this, as you can see, A.

This is now an element of B.

Then A is an element of set B, Okay.

For instance, this.

This is a set.

Inside another set.

A set inside another set with another element.

So this is considered as an object.

Considered as an object too.

Okay.

You can have something like this.

What?

In the set, for instance, this is a null set.

This.

This is a set with a single value that is single.

And this is a set with two elements.

This, this if this are sets inside another set, we have three sets here because this is a null set

which you already know is represented like this.

Okay.

And this is a set.

This is set.

It's a set.

They are the same with this.

You now understand that what is set can be considered what as an object.
