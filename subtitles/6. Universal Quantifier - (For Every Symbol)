Let's look at another symbol that is very important in set.

This.

That is you turn a upside down.

This is called for every or all that is for every.

Every element for every element.

All you say, all elements.

So if I do this.

For instance, it means I want to put a condition after this expression.

I want to make a statement.

You don't just do this without trying to make a statement.

I want to talk something about every element of a particular set.

So this is used to represent.

A general statement.

That applies.

To all elements.

In a set.

Okay.

If you have a statement about all the elements in the set you bring, this discipline means for all

X For all x.

Okay.

That is.

For all X or for every.

X.

All or every X as representing each of the elements.

So if I do this.

What do I mean?

If you say something like this?

What is the meaning of this?

Discipline means for every X element of E, every x element of E or for every x, that is element of

E.

You can write this as for every X element.

Of E or.

For every x that is an element of E.

Okay.

So when you see this.

Okay.

So when you see this, it means a statement that we follow.

There's going to be a statement here.

For now, we don't have one because we have not defined any set.

But if you see this, it means the statement that follows is applicable to every element.

Offset E.

Because this what element of this means every each and every element of E.

Okay.

Assume you want to say this, for instance.

Say, for instance, let's say if A is equal to one, two, three, four, five.

And I want to say concerning this is that all these elements are positive numbers.

That is, they are all positive.

You agree with me?

This is positive.

That positivity is also applicable to also applicable to theory, also applicable to four and five.

Because that word positive.

We find it here, you find it here, we find it there.

It is common across the board.

Therefore, you can write this like this by saying every x element of a.

Well, what's is greater than zero.

You are positive if you are greater than zero.

Okay.

So you can see they are all greater than zero.

If you are less than zero.

You becomes what?

Negative.

You can say this condition that is following this notation.

Is true.

For every of these elements.
