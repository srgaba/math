# Universal Quantifier in Set Theory

The universal quantifier is a crucial symbol in set theory and mathematical logic, representing the concept of "for every" or "all."

## Concept
- The symbol for the universal quantifier is an upside-down 'A' ( ∀ ).
- It is used to indicate that a statement or condition applies to every element of a particular set.

## Usage
- When using this symbol, it typically precedes a statement or expression.
- It's not used in isolation but to make a generalized statement about every element in a set.

## Example
- A statement like "∀x, x > 0" means "for every x, x is greater than 0."
- This expression would be used to make a broad statement about the elements of a set, in this case, indicating that every element x is greater than zero.
- Example, given this Set B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the statement "∀x ∈ A, x > 0" would be true because every element in the set is greater than zero.

Summary: The universal quantifier is a fundamental symbol in mathematical logic, used to express statements that apply universally to every element of a set.
