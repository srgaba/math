# Introduction to Set Theory: Summary and Key Points

### Definition of a Set:

A set is essentially a collection of items or elements.
Key Term: Collection â€“ It's crucial to understand that a set is formed only when there is a collection of items. Without a collection, there can't be a set.

### Examples of Sets:

Sets can include a wide variety of items, such as a set of people, animals, or plants. These examples help illustrate the concept of a set in everyday contexts.

### Characteristics of Sets:

The elements within a set must be distinct and well-defined.
Distinct means that each element is unique within the set.
Well-defined indicates that there should be no ambiguity about what the elements are. Each item in the set should be clearly identifiable.

### Importance of Distinct and Well-Defined Elements:

Having distinct and well-defined elements is essential for the integrity of a set. It ensures that each element is uniquely identifiable and that the set as a whole is clearly defined.
