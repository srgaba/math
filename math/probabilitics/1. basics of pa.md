## Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science: An Introduction

This document introduces the fundamental concept of probability in the context of data science and business analytics.

**Probability** is defined as the likelihood of an event occurring. An event represents a specific outcome or a combination of outcomes. 

**Probability values** are expressed numerically using real numbers between 0 and 1, where 1 represents absolute certainty of an event occurring and 0 represents absolute certainty of the event not occurring. Higher probability values indicate a higher likelihood.

**Calculating Probability:**

The probability of an event, denoted as P(A), is calculated as the number of preferred (or favorable) outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. 

**Examples:**

* **Flipping a coin and getting heads:**
    * Preferred outcome: 1 (heads)
    * Total outcomes: 2 (heads or tails)
    * P(heads) = 1/2 = 0.5

* **Rolling a four on a six-sided die:**
    * Preferred outcome: 1 (rolling a four)
    * Total outcomes: 6 (numbers 1 to 6)
    * P(rolling a four) = 1/6 ≈ 0.167

* **Rolling a number divisible by three on a six-sided die:**
    * Preferred outcomes: 2 (rolling a three or a six)
    * Total outcomes: 6 
    * P(rolling a number divisible by three) = 2/6 ≈ 0.33

**The Probability of Multiple Events:**

The probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

**Example:**

The probability of getting the ace of spades in a deck of cards is equal to the probability of getting an ace multiplied by the probability of getting a spade.

**Applications of Probability:**

Probability plays a crucial role in data science and business analytics, enabling professionals to:

* **Make informed decisions:** By understanding the likelihood of different outcomes, businesses can make informed decisions regarding investments, marketing strategies, and risk management.
* **Predict future events:** Statistical models based on probability can help forecast future trends and behaviors, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
* **Analyze data patterns:** Probability helps identify patterns and relationships in data, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights.

This introduction lays the foundation for understanding probability as a fundamental concept in data science and its applications in various fields. The next step involves exploring the concept of expected values and their role in decision-making.
